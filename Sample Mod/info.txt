**************************************

This is the very first pass at modding, so the only thing you can mod is the game's music. Soon you'll also be able to edit 3D models, sound effects, localization, and gameplay data as well.

To replace the game's music, place any of the following files in this directory:

Music_Space.wav
Music_Combat.wav
Music_Spring.wav
Music_Summer.wav
Music_Fall.wav
Music_Winter.wav

(Capitalization matters! Make sure your wav files have names like "Music_Spring.wav", not "music_spring.wav")
